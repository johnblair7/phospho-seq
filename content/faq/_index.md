      title: ### How many antibodies can you include in a single Phospho-seq experiment?
      subtitle:
      text: <font size= “3”> Because all of the antibodies are individually conjugated with complex 15 nt indices as part of the larger DNA-oligo, in theory you can use a near unlimited number of antibodies. I have used up to 100 antibodies in a single experiment with no problems in detection.
