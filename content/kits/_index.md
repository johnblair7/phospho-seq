      title: Phospho-seq Starter Kits
      text: |- 
      In collaboration with the Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis (link: https://www.multimodalintegration.org/). We are happy to offer Phospho-seq Starter Kits to make it easier for users to try Phospho-seq out for themselves! If you are interested in receiving a kit, please fill out this form. We’ll follow up by e-mail with a standard Material Transfer Agreement and request for a FedEx account number.
<br>
We have observed that one of the largest obstacles in performing antibody-based single-cell protein profiling including ASAP-seq (link), inCITE-seq (link), NEAT-seq (link), QURIE-seq (link) and others is the limited commercial availability of pre-conjugated antibodies, especially for intracellular proteins. For Phospho-seq we adapted an already established click-chemistry-based DNA-antibody conjugation method (link to Van Buggenum) to create large panels of custom conjugated antibodies. In this Phospho-seq starter kit, we provide the material to conjugate up to four antibodies of the user’s choice with four separately indexed labeled TSB DNA oligos as well as a pre-conjugated control antibody for phospho-RPS6. We also provide a bridge oligo for use in the 10X scATAC-seq and scMultiome kits for antibody capture.

We hope that these kits remove some of the barriers of entry to using this technology and are excited to see what users do with them!
